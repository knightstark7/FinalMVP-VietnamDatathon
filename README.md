## Project Description

Team DATADA participated in the Vietnam Datathon 2023, ranking in the top 24 with their innovative MVP. The project focused on addressing key challenges in the retail sector by developing a web-based platform using Streamlit. This platform integrates advanced machine learning and deep learning models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and statistical models like SARIMAX for robust time series forecasting and data analytics.

The core functionality of the platform revolves around providing sales forecasting and price optimization solutions. By leveraging advanced analytics and predictive modeling techniques, the platform offers valuable insights for retail businesses to enhance their decision-making process, ultimately leading to improved operational efficiency and profitability.
